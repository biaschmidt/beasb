# About Me

I am an economist graduated from UFRJ and hold a master’s in business administration from PUC-Rio. For the past four years, I have worked as a data scientist, using analytical and econometric methods to work with large datasets in areas such as economics, health, labor markets, and innovation. My experience covers the full data analysis process, from integrating and modeling complex databases to turning results into clear insights that support decision-making. I have worked with impact evaluation, employment forecasting, and the development of analytical tools that help explain trends and guide practical actions. I am interested in how data can improve public policy, anticipate economic changes, and reveal shifts in labor market dynamics. My focus is always on combining technical accuracy with clear and transparent communication.
